Data/ Seating Arrangements:

1) In a college auditorium, seats are arranged in rows and columns. Each seat is assigned a unique seat number starting from 1. Write a Python program that takes the number of rows, number of columns, and a seat number as input, and prints whether the seat belongs to the CSE department or the ECE department based on its position
 If the student sits in first row, first column and last column print the output as "CSE" , if the student sits in the middle print "ECE". If the input exceeds number of seats print "Seat No. exceeds number of seats"

Code:

Row = int(input("No. of Rows: "))
Col = int(input("No. of cols: "))
Seat = int(input("Enter Seat no.: "))

if Seat <= Col or Seat % Col == 0 or Seat % Col == 1:
        print("CSE")
        
    else:
        print("ECE")

    else:
        print("Seat No. exceeds number of seats:")



Data Crunching:

2) Write a Java program that reads a number as a string input from the user and calculates the sum of the first and last digits of the number.

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = sc.nextInt();

        int lastDigit = num % 10;

        int firstDigit = num;
        while (firstDigit >= 10) {
            firstDigit /= 10;
        }

        int sum = firstDigit + lastDigit;
        System.out.println("Sum of first and last digits: " + sum);
    }
}
